      <section>
        <p> 
          Hey! I'm Zoya, an undergraduate at Columbia University majoring in Cognitive Science with double minors in Computer Science and Anthropology. 
          I am passionate about understanding human higher-level cognition, focusing on data-driven approaches to understanding the mind. My love for visual art
          has inspired the way I approach cognitive science — studying not just how the brain works but how it perceives, interprets, and creates meaning. 
        </p>

        <p>
          You can view my <a href="/assets/cv.pdf">CV here</a> and read more about my experiences below.
        </p>
        
        <h2 id="research">Research</h2>
        <p>
          At large, I’m interested in how systems neuroscience (including computational models that  combine physiology with system variability) 
          scales up/explains higher-order cognitive phenomena like memory, decision-making, and learning.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          At the <a href="https://www.losonczylab.org/">Losonczy Lab</a>, I work on a project, advised by Abhi Shah, that investigates how CA1 organization 
          affects representations and behavior outputs in the hippocampus. I developed Python-based pipelines to process and analyze data from behavioral recordings and 
          neural activity from two-photon calcium imaging experiments. I also perform stereotaxic surgeries (such as viral injections, headpost, and cannula implantations)
          as well as train mice daily on a virtual reality (VR) based decision-making task. With this, I design and implement various cued 
          and stimulation-centered VR paradigms, assess their effectiveness via pipelines, and iterate experimental designs accordingly.

        <p>
          At the <a href="https://www.bathlab.net/">Bath Lab</a>, I contribute to studies examining the intergenerational 
          effects of early life adversity on maternal care and offspring outcomes. I use EthoVision XT to score detailed maternal behaviors — such as nursing posture, kicking, and circling — helping quantify behavioral patterns critical to understanding developmental trajectories in rodent models.
        </p>

        <p>
          I'm drawn to CogSci because of its foundations in the philosophy of science. Through coursework in philosophy, linguistics, and neuroscience, I've come to adopt   
          to hold a moderate empiricist view of cognition: while we may begin with certain innate structures or primitives (for ex, the concept of an 'agent'), these are scaffolded into relevant representations through experience and sensory input. <br> 
          Some relevant papers I've written for courses:
        </p>

        <p>
          <em>Cognitive Flexibility Through Context-Dependent Memory Encoding: How Latent Task Structures Drive State Orthogonalization in the Hippocampus</em> <br>
          Paper written for PHIL 3655: Topics in Cognitive Science and Philosophy, taught by Dr. Brendan Fleig-Goldstein, Spring 2025. <br>
          This paper situates a 2025 study on cognitive maps and orthogonalization in the hippocampus within Cameron Buckner's theory of 
          Domain General Modular Architecture. Through this exploration, I advocate for a restructuring of our understanding of memory’s function and organization, 
          not as a passive repository of sensory inputs, but as a dynamic system that constructs task-relevant distinctions between overlapping experiences. <br>

        <p>
          <em>Image Quantization via k-means Clustering for Analyzing Oil Spill Data</em> <br>
          Group project writeup written for MATH 2015: Linear Algebra & Probability, taught by Dr. Evan Sorenson, Fall 2024. <br>
          This report discusses an application of image quantization, via a k-means clustering algorithm, to analyze a dataset of oil spill satellite images 
          and evaluate the effectiveness of this method (for data reduction) in accurately computing the percentage of oil spills.
          Our findings explore the limitations of k-means clustering in the analysis of dynamic datasets that have feature and environmental variability.

        <h2 id="experience">Experience</h2>
        <p>
          I serve as the undergraduate liaison at the Zuckerman Mind Brain Behavior Institute, where I 
          Through this, I've gained skills in project management.
