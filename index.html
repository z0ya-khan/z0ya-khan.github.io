        <p> 
          Hey! I'm Zoya, an undergraduate at Columbia University majoring in Cognitive Science with double minors in Computer Science and Anthropology. 
          I am passionate about understanding human higher-level cognition, focusing on data-driven approaches to understanding the mind. My love for visual art
          has inspired the way I approach cognitive science — studying not just how the brain works but how it perceives, interprets, and creates meaning.

        <p>
          You can view my <a href="/assets/cv.pdf">CV here</a> and read more about my experiences below.

        <p>
          At large, I’m interested in how systems neuroscience (including computational models that  combine physiology with system variability) 
          scales up/explains higher-order cognitive phenomena like memory, decision-making, and learning. I love CogSci because of its foundations in the
          philosophy of science. I

          I love CogSci because of its foundations in the philosophy of science. Expansive coursework in philosophy, linguistics, and neuroscience has led me  
          to hold a moderate empiricist view of cognition: we have some innate structures and principles (for ex, 'agent') that are scaffolded into relevant representations through experience and sensory input. <br> 
          Some relevant papers written for courses: <br>
         
          <em>Cognitive Flexibility Through Context-Dependent Memory Encoding: How Latent Task Structures Drive State Orthogonalization in the Hippocampus</em> <br>
          Paper written for PHIL 3655: Topics in Cognitive Science and Philosophy, taught by Dr. Brendan Fleig-Goldstein. <br>
          This paper situates a 2025 study on cognitive maps and orthogonalization in the hippocampus within Cameron Buckner's theory of 
          Domain General Modular Architecture. Through this exploration, I advocate for a restructuring of our understanding of memory’s function and organization, 
          not as a passive repository of sensory inputs, but as a dynamic system that constructs task-relevant distinctions between overlapping experiences. <br>
          (<a href="/assets/zk_cogsciphil.pdf">Link</a>)

          <em>Image Quantization via k-means Clustering for Analyzing Oil Spill Data</em> <br>
          Group project writeup written for MATH 2015: Linear Algebra & Probability, taught by Dr. Evan Sorenson. <br>
          This report discusses an application of image quantization, via a k-means clustering algorithm, to analyze a dataset of oil spill satellite images 
          and evaluate the effectiveness of this method (for data reduction) in accurately computing the percentage of oil spills.
          Our findings explore the limitations of k-means clustering in the analysis of dynamic datasets that have feature and environmental variability.
